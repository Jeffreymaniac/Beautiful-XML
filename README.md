## How to use/Documentation

The `<group>` tag allows for grouping of a particular section (like the HTML `<div>` tag).
You use `<text>` for text/paragraphs like the HTML `<p>` tag.

### Colors:

`bgcolor` is the attribute for a background color, while `tcolor` is for a text color.
Attribute values:
* Red
* Orange
* Yellow
* Green
* Blue
* Purple
* Violet
* Black
* Brown
* White
* Red
* Chartreuse
* RebeccaPurple
* and almost every HTML color name

This cannot accept rgb values or any type of hex or color code, it only accepts the colors as their color names (ex. red, blue etc.).
If you would like more colors for text and background colors, then please contact me.

### Fonts:

The attribute to add a font is `font`. This uses Google Fonts for some.

Attribute values:
* Roboto
* Open-Sans
* Cabin
* Comic-Sans
* Monospace

If you would like more fonts, contact me.

The attribute to add a font size is `fontsize`. It supports every number up to 35. I plan to add numbers all up to 100.
