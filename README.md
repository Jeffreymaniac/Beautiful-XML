## Documentation

The `<group>` tag allows for grouping of a particular section.

### Colors:

`bgcolor` is the attribute for a background color, while `tcolor` is an attribute for a text color.
Attribute values:
* Red
* Orange
* Yellow
* Green
* Blue
* Purple
* Violet

This cannot accept rgb values or any type of hex or color code, it can only accept the colors in word form (ex. red, blue etc.).
If you would like more colors for text and background colors, then please contact me.

### Fonts:

The attribute to add a font is `font`. This uses Google Fonts, so credits to Google Api's.

Attribute values:
* Roboto
* Open-Sans
* Merriweather
* Cabin
* Comic-Sans
* Indie-Flower
* Monospace

If you would like more fonts, contact me.

The attribute to add a font size is `fontsize`. It supports every number up to 35. I plan to add numbers all up to 100.
